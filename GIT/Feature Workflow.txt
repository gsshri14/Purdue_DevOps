A complete example demonstrating a Feature Branch Flow is as follows.

 Assuming we have a repo setup with a main branch.

git checkout main
git checkout -b develop
git checkout -b feature_branch
# work happens on feature branch
git checkout develop
git merge feature_branch
git checkout main
git merge develop
git branch -d feature_branch

In addition to the feature and release flow, a hotfix example is as follows:

git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix_branch
# work is done commits are added to the hotfix_branch
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix_branch
git checkout main
git merge hotfix_branch
